\subsection{Key Terms}
%TODO extract into a glossary
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Capacitors} - Stores electrical energy by accumulating electric charge. Two terminals, one in and one out.
  \item \textbf{Transistor} - Amplifies or switches electrical signals. Uses three terminals, a current or voltage applied to one terminal (normally the middle terminal) will control the conductance of the semiconducting material from the first terminal to the last terminal. See figure~\ref{fig-tran}.
\end{itemize}
