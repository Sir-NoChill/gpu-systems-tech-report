\chapter{Introduction - \textit{Danila Seliayeu}}

This portion of the report motivates and covers the architectural design of the GPGPU.

We start off introducing how graphics processing tasks shaped the hardware of the GPU and how the GPU evolved to cover more complex graphics processing tasks.
The generality of the design naturally leads us to the exploration of how the GPGPU works at the architectural level.
We then end this section by covering interesting developments in recent GPUs that relate to the discussed architectural content.
